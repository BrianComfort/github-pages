                <div id="book-wrapper">
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1-1">In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that
                            I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-2-1">“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember
                            that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-3-1">He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a
                            reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-3-2">In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has
                            opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran
                            bores.</span><span id="gatsby-3-3">The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to
                            this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was
                            unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,
                            unknown men.</span><span id="gatsby-3-4">Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I
                            have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable
                            sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations
                            of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and
                            marred by obvious suppressions.</span><span id="gatsby-3-5">Reserving judgements is a matter
                            of infinite hope.</span><span id="gatsby-3-6">I am still a little afraid of missing
                            something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a
                            sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-4-1">And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that
                            it has a limit.</span><span id="gatsby-4-2">Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the
                            wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-4-3">When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to
                            be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions
                            with privileged glimpses into the human heart.</span><span id="gatsby-4-4">Only Gatsby, the
                            man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented
                            everything for which I have an unaffected scorn.</span><span id="gatsby-4-5">If personality
                            is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,
                            some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those
                            intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-4-6">This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability
                            which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift
                            for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it
                            is not likely I shall ever find again.</span><span id="gatsby-4-7">No—Gatsby turned out all
                            right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his
                            dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded
                            elations of men.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-5-1">My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western
                            city for three generations.</span><span id="gatsby-5-2">The Carraways are something of a
                            clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the
                            actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a
                            substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father
                            carries on today.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-6-1">I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with
                            special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s
                            office.</span><span id="gatsby-6-2">I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a
                            century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic
                            migration known as the Great War.</span><span id="gatsby-6-3">I enjoyed the counter-raid so
                            thoroughly that I came back restless.</span><span id="gatsby-6-4">Instead of being the warm
                            centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I
                            decided to go East and learn the bond business.</span><span id="gatsby-6-5">Everybody I knew
                            was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-6-6">All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep
                            school for me, and finally said, “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-6-7">Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came
                            East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-7-1">The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm
                            season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man
                            at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a
                            great idea.</span><span id="gatsby-7-2">He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard
                            bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I
                            went out to the country alone.</span><span id="gatsby-7-3">I had a dog—at least I had him
                            for a few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and
                            cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-8-1">It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently
                            arrived than I, stopped me on the road.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-9-1">“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-10-1">I told him.</span><span id="gatsby-10-2">And as I walked on I was lonely
                            no longer.</span><span id="gatsby-10-3">I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original
                            settler.</span><span id="gatsby-10-4">He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the
                            neighbourhood.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-11-1">And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the
                            trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was
                            beginning over again with the summer.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-12-1">There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be
                            pulled down out of the young breath-giving air.</span><span id="gatsby-12-2">I bought a
                            dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in
                            red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only
                            Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew.</span><span id="gatsby-12-3">And I had the high
                            intention of reading many other books besides.</span><span id="gatsby-12-4">I was rather
                            literary in college—one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the
                            Yale News—and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again
                            that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an
                            epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-13-1">It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the
                            strangest communities in North America.</span><span id="gatsby-13-2">It was on that slender
                            riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other
                            natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land.</span><span id="gatsby-13-3">Twenty
                            miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a
                            courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western
                            hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.</span><span id="gatsby-13-4">They
                            are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the
                            contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls
                            that fly overhead.</span><span id="gatsby-13-5">To the wingless a more interesting
                            phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-14-1">I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though
                            this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast
                            between them.</span><span id="gatsby-14-2">My house was at the very tip of the egg, only
                            fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or
                            fifteen thousand a season.</span><span id="gatsby-14-3">The one on my right was a colossal
                            affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a
                            tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool,
                            and more than forty acres of lawn and garden.</span><span id="gatsby-14-4">It was Gatsby’s
                            mansion.</span><span id="gatsby-14-5">Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a
                            mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name.</span><span id="gatsby-14-6">My own house was
                            an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the
                            water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of
                            millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-15-1">Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg
                            glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I
                            drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans.</span><span id="gatsby-15-2">Daisy
                            was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-15-3">And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-16-1">Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the
                            most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of
                            those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward
                            savours of anticlimax.</span><span id="gatsby-16-2">His family were enormously wealthy—even
                            in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and
                            come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a
                            string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.</span><span id="gatsby-16-3">It was hard to realize
                            that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-17-1">Why they came East I don’t know.</span><span id="gatsby-17-2">They had
                            spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully
                            wherever people played polo and were rich together.</span><span id="gatsby-17-3">This was a
                            permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into
                            Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for
                            the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-18-1">And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg
                            to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all.</span><span id="gatsby-18-2">Their house
                            was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion,
                            overlooking the bay.</span><span id="gatsby-18-3">The lawn started at the beach and ran
                            towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and
                            burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as
                            though from the momentum of its run.</span><span id="gatsby-18-4">The front was broken by a
                            line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy
                            afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front
                            porch.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-19-1">He had changed since his New Haven years.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-19-2">Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth
                            and a supercilious manner.</span><span id="gatsby-19-3">Two shining arrogant eyes had
                            established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning
                            aggressively forward.</span><span id="gatsby-19-4">Not even the effeminate swank of his
                            riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening
                            boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting
                            when his shoulder moved under his thin coat.</span><span id="gatsby-19-5">It was a body
                            capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-20-1">His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of
                            fractiousness he conveyed.</span><span id="gatsby-20-2">There was a touch of paternal
                            contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated
                            his guts.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-21-1">“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to
                            say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior
                            society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me
                            and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-22-1">We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-23-1">“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about
                            restlessly.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-24-1">Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front
                            vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses,
                            and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-25-1">“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again,
                            politely and abruptly.</span><span id="gatsby-25-2">“We’ll go inside.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-26-1">We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,
                            fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-26-2">The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside
                            that seemed to grow a little way into the house.</span><span id="gatsby-26-3">A breeze blew
                            through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting
                            them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the
                            wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-27-1">The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch
                            on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-27-2">They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as
                            if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-27-3">I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the
                            curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.</span><span id="gatsby-27-4">Then there was
                            a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room,
                            and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-28-1">The younger of the two was a stranger to me.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-28-2">She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely
                            motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it
                            which was quite likely to fall.</span><span id="gatsby-28-3">If she saw me out of the corner
                            of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology
                            for having disturbed her by coming in.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-29-1">The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly
                            forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh,
                            and I laughed too and came forward into the room.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-30-1">“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-31-1">She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand
                            for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so
                            much wanted to see.</span><span id="gatsby-31-2">That was a way she had.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-31-3">She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was
                            Baker.</span><span id="gatsby-31-4">(I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make
                            people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-32-1">At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost
                            imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had
                            obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-32-2">Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-32-3">Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute
                            from me.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-33-1">I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,
                            thrilling voice.</span><span id="gatsby-33-2">It was the kind of voice that the ear follows
                            up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played
                            again.</span><span id="gatsby-33-3">Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,
                            bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men
                            who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,”
                            a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,
                            exciting things hovering in the next hour.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-34-1">I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and
                            how a dozen people had sent their love through me.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-35-1">“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-36-1">“The whole town is desolate.</span><span id="gatsby-36-2">All the cars
                            have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail
                            all night along the north shore.”</span>
                    </p>

                            Tom.</span><span id="gatsby-37-3">Tomorrow!” Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought to see
                            the baby.”</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-42-1">Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped
                            and rested his hand on my shoulder.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-46-1">I told him.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-47-1">“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-48-1">This annoyed me.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-49-1">“You will,” I answered shortly.</span><span id="gatsby-49-2">“You will if
                            you stay in the East.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-50-1">“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy
                            and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-50-2">“I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-51-1">At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I
                            started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-51-2">Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a
                            series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-52-1">“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as

                        <span id="gatsby-53-1">“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to New

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-54-1">“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-55-1">Her host looked at her incredulously.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-56-1">“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-57-1">I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I enjoyed
                            looking at her.</span><span id="gatsby-57-2">She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an
                            erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-61-1">“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy.</span><span id="gatsby-61-2">“What
                            Gatsby?”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-62-1">Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;
                            wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as
                            though he were moving a checker to another square.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-63-1">Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two
                            young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward the sunset, where four
                            candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-64-1">“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning.</span><span id="gatsby-64-2">She
                            snapped them out with her fingers.</span><span id="gatsby-64-3">“In two weeks it’ll be the

                        <span id="gatsby-65-1">“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-66-1">“All right,” said Daisy.</span><span id="gatsby-66-2">“What’ll we plan?”
                            She turned to me helplessly: “What do people plan?”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-67-1">Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-71-1">“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-72-1">“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-73-1">Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a
                            bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white
                            dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-73-2">They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant
                            effort to entertain or to be entertained.</span><span id="gatsby-73-3">They knew that
                            presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually
                            put away.</span><span id="gatsby-73-4">It was sharply different from the West, where an
                            evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed
                            anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-74-1">“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass of
                            corky but rather impressive claret.</span><span id="gatsby-74-2">“Can’t you talk about crops
                            or something?”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-75-1">I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-76-1">“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-76-2">“I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things.</span><span

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-77-1">“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-78-1">“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it.</span><span

                        <span id="gatsby-79-1">“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of
                            unthoughtful sadness.</span><span id="gatsby-79-2">“He reads deep books with long words in
                            them.</span><span id="gatsby-79-3">What was that word we—”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-80-1">“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her
                            impatiently.</span><span id="gatsby-80-2">“This fellow has worked out the whole
                            thing.</span><span id="gatsby-80-3">It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out
                            or these other races will have control of things.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-81-1">“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously
                            toward the fervent sun.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-82-1">“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted
                            her by shifting heavily in his chair.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-83-1">“This idea is that we’re Nordics.</span><span id="gatsby-83-2">I am, and
                            you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a
                            slight nod, and she winked at me again.</span><span id="gatsby-83-3">“—And we’ve produced
                            all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that.</span><span

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-84-1">There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency,
                            more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.</span><span id="gatsby-84-2">When,
                            almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized
                            upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-85-1">“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered
                            enthusiastically.</span><span id="gatsby-85-2">“It’s about the butler’s nose.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-85-3">Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-86-1">“That’s why I came over tonight.”</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-87-1">“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for

                            id="gatsby-87-2">He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to

                        <span id="gatsby-88-1">“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-89-1">“Yes.</span><span id="gatsby-89-2">Things went from bad to worse, until

                        <span id="gatsby-90-1">For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her
                            glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded,
                            each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at
                            dusk.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-91-1">The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon
                            Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-91-2">As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward

                        <span id="gatsby-94-1">Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of

                            “Sh!” in a warning voice.</span><span id="gatsby-94-3">A subdued impassioned murmur was
                            audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to

                            mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.</span>

                            time.</span><span id="gatsby-103-2">Don’t you think?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-104-1">Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress
                            and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-105-1">“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-106-1">She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and
                            continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-106-2">There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on
                            the Cunard or White Star Line.</span><span id="gatsby-106-3">He’s singing away—” Her voice
                            sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-107-1">“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light
                            enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-108-1">The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head
                            decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into
                            air.</span><span id="gatsby-108-2">Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at
                            table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to
                            look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes.</span><span id="gatsby-108-3">I
                            couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed
                            to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s
                            shrill metallic urgency out of mind.</span><span id="gatsby-108-4">To a certain temperament
                            the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for
                            the police.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-109-1">The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-109-2">Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled
                            back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to
                            look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting
                            verandas to the porch in front.</span><span id="gatsby-109-3">In its deep gloom we sat down
                            side by side on a wicker settee.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-110-1">Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her
                            eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk.</span><span id="gatsby-110-2">I saw that
                            turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions
                            about her little girl.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-111-1">“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said

                            id="gatsby-111-3">You didn’t come to my wedding.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-113-1">“That’s true.” She hesitated.</span><span id="gatsby-113-2">“Well, I’ve
                            had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-114-1">Evidently she had reason to be.</span><span id="gatsby-114-2">I waited
                            but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of
                            her daughter.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-116-1">“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently.</span><span

                        <span id="gatsby-118-1">“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-118-2">Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows
                            where.</span><span id="gatsby-118-3">I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned
                            feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-118-4">She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and
                            wept.</span><span id="gatsby-118-5">‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-118-6">And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this

                        <span id="gatsby-119-1">“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a
                            convinced way.</span><span id="gatsby-119-2">“Everybody thinks so—the most advanced
                            people.</span><span id="gatsby-119-3">And I know.</span><span id="gatsby-119-4">I’ve been
                            everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a
                            defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-119-5">“Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-120-1">The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my
                            belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.</span><span id="gatsby-120-2">It
                            made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a
                            contributory emotion from me.</span><span id="gatsby-120-3">I waited, and sure enough, in a
                            moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted
                            her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom
                            belonged.</span>

                            id="gatsby-121-2">Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud
                            to him from the Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together
                            in a soothing tune.</span><span id="gatsby-121-3">The lamplight, bright on his boots and
                            dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page
                            with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-122-1">When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-123-1">“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our

                            motor Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-145-1">“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-145-2">We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-146-1">“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-146-2">“We heard that you were engaged.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-147-1">“It’s a libel.</span><span id="gatsby-147-2">I’m too poor.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-148-1">“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in
                            a flower-like way.</span><span id="gatsby-148-2">“We heard it from three people, so it must
                            be true.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-149-1">Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely
                            engaged.</span><span id="gatsby-149-2">The fact that gossip had published the banns was one
                            of the reasons I had come East.</span><span id="gatsby-149-3">You can’t stop going with an
                            old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured
                            into marriage.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-150-1">Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely
                            rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-150-2">It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the
                            house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-150-3">As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less
                            surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-150-4">Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his
                            sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-151-1">Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside
                            garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate
                            at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in
                            the yard.</span><span id="gatsby-151-2">The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright
                            night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of
                            the earth blew the frogs full of life.</span><span id="gatsby-151-3">The silhouette of a
                            moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was
                            not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour’s mansion and
                            was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the
                            stars.</span><span id="gatsby-151-4">Something in his leisurely movements and the secure
                            position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to
                            determine what share was his of our local heavens.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-152-1">I decided to call to him.</span><span id="gatsby-152-2">Miss Baker had
                            mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-152-3">But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was
                            content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and,
                            far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-152-4">Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single
                            green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-152-5">When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again
                            in the unquiet darkness.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-153-1">II
                            About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and
                            runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of
                            land.</span><span id="gatsby-153-2">This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes
                            grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of
                            houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of ash-grey
                            men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-153-3">Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives
                            out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with
                            leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from
                            your sight.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-154-1">But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift
                            endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-154-2">J.</span><span id="gatsby-154-3">Eckleburg.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-154-4">The eyes of Doctor T.</span><span id="gatsby-154-5">J.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-154-6">Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard
                            high.</span><span id="gatsby-154-7">They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of
                            enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-154-8">Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his
                            practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or
                            forgot them and moved away.</span><span id="gatsby-154-9">But his eyes, dimmed a little by
                            many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-155-1">The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and,
                            when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare
                            at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour.</span><span id="gatsby-155-2">There is
                            always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom
                            Buchanan’s mistress.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-156-1">The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was
                            known.</span><span id="gatsby-156-2">His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up
                            in popular cafés with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with
                            whomsoever he knew.</span><span id="gatsby-156-3">Though I was curious to see her, I had no
                            desire to meet her—but I did.</span><span id="gatsby-156-4">I went up to New York with Tom
                            on the train one afternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet and,
                            taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-157-1">“We’re getting off,” he insisted.</span><span id="gatsby-157-2">“I want
                            you to meet my girl.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-158-1">I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination to
                            have my company bordered on violence.</span><span id="gatsby-158-2">The supercilious
                            assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-159-1">I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back
                            a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s persistent stare.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-159-2">The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on
                            the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous
                            to absolutely nothing.</span><span id="gatsby-159-3">One of the three shops it contained was
                            for rent and another was an all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third
                            was a garage—Repairs.</span><span id="gatsby-159-4">George B.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-159-5">Wilson.</span><span id="gatsby-159-6">Cars bought and sold.—and I followed
                            Tom inside.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-160-1">The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the
                            dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-160-2">It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and
                            that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the proprietor himself
                            appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-160-3">He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-160-4">When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue
                            eyes.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-161-1">“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the
                            shoulder.</span><span id="gatsby-161-2">“How’s business?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-162-1">“I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-162-2">“When are you going to sell me that car?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-163-1">“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-164-1">“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-165-1">“No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly.</span><span id="gatsby-165-2">“And if
                            you feel that way about it, maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-166-1">“I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-166-2">“I just meant—”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-167-1">His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the
                            garage.</span><span id="gatsby-167-2">Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment
                            the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-167-3">She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her
                            flesh sensuously as some women can.</span><span id="gatsby-167-4">Her face, above a spotted
                            dress of dark blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an
                            immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually
                            smouldering.</span><span id="gatsby-167-5">She smiled slowly and, walking through her
                            husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the
                            eye.</span><span id="gatsby-167-6">Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke
                            to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-168-1">“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-169-1">“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office,
                            mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls.</span><span id="gatsby-169-2">A
                            white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the
                            vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-170-1">“I want to see you,” said Tom intently.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-170-2">“Get on the next train.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-171-1">“All right.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-172-1">“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-173-1">She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with
                            two chairs from his office door.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-181-1">She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched
                            tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-181-2">At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture
                            magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of
                            perfume.</span><span id="gatsby-181-3">Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four
                            taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery,
                            and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine.</span><span

                        <span id="gatsby-188-1">“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-189-1">“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment in
                            his voice.</span><span id="gatsby-189-2">“It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-192-1">The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it
                            somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into
                            Mrs.</span><span id="gatsby-192-2">Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weatherproof coat

                        <span id="gatsby-196-1">We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the

                        <span id="gatsby-197-1">“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-202-1">“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in the

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-203-1">The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small
                            dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath.</span><span id="gatsby-203-2">The living-room was
                            crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that
                            to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of
                            Versailles.</span><span id="gatsby-203-3">The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph,
                            apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.</span><span id="gatsby-203-4">Looked at from a
                            distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old
                            lady beamed down into the room.</span><span id="gatsby-203-5">Several old copies of Town
                            Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small
                            scandal magazines of Broadway.</span><span id="gatsby-203-6">Mrs.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-203-7">Wilson was first concerned with the dog.</span><span id="gatsby-203-8">A
                            reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his
                            own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in
                            the saucer of milk all afternoon.</span><span id="gatsby-203-9">Meanwhile Tom brought out a
                            bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-204-1">I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that
                            afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after
                            eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun.</span><span id="gatsby-204-2">Sitting
                            on Tom’s lap Mrs.</span><span id="gatsby-204-3">Wilson called up several people on the
                            telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the
                            corner.</span><span id="gatsby-204-4">When I came back they had both disappeared, so I sat
                            down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was
                            terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to
                            me.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-205-1">Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-205-2">Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company
                            commenced to arrive at the apartment door.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-206-1">The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with
                            a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-206-2">Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish
                            angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred
                            air to her face.</span><span id="gatsby-206-3">When she moved about there was an incessant
                            clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-206-4">She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so
                            possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-206-5">But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud,
                            and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-207-1">Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-207-2">He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone,
                            and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-207-3">He informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later
                            that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-207-4">Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-207-5">His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-207-6">She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and
                            twenty-seven times since they had been married.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-208-1">Mrs.</span><span id="gatsby-208-2">Wilson had changed her costume some
                            time before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,
                            which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-208-3">With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a
                            change.</span><span id="gatsby-208-4">The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in

                            wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-266-1">“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-267-1">“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously.</span><span

                            strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair.</span><span

                            drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and
                            hair bobbed in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-293-3">The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the
                            garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and
                            introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew
                            each other’s names.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-294-1">The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now
                            the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key
                            higher.</span><span id="gatsby-294-2">Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with
                            prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word.</span><span id="gatsby-294-3">The groups change
                            more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there
                            are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable,
                            become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,
                            glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing
                            light.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-295-1">Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out
                            of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on
                            the canvas platform.</span><span id="gatsby-295-2">A momentary hush; the orchestra leader
                            varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news
                            goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s understudy from the Follies.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-295-3">The party has begun.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-296-1">I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one of
                            the few guests who had actually been invited.</span><span id="gatsby-296-2">People were not
                            invited—they went there.</span><span id="gatsby-296-3">They got into automobiles which bore
                            them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-296-4">Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after
                            that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated with an
                            amusement park.</span><span id="gatsby-296-5">Sometimes they came and went without having
                            met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of
                            admission.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-297-1">I had been actually invited.</span><span id="gatsby-297-2">A chauffeur
                            in a uniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a
                            surprisingly formal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby’s, it said,
                            if I would attend his “little party” that night.</span><span id="gatsby-297-3">He had seen
                            me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of
                            circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-298-1">Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after
                            seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn’t
                            know—though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-298-2">I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about;
                            all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to
                            solid and prosperous Americans.</span><span id="gatsby-298-3">I was sure that they were
                            selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles.</span><span id="gatsby-298-4">They
                            were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was
                            theirs for a few words in the right key.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-299-1">As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or
                            three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied
                            so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direction of the
                            cocktail table—the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking
                            purposeless and alone.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-300-1">I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when
                            Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a
                            little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-301-1">Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before
                            I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-302-1">“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-302-2">My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-303-1">“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came
                            up.</span><span id="gatsby-303-2">“I remembered you lived next door to—”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-304-1">She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me
                            in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of
                            the steps.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-305-1">“Hello!” they cried together.</span><span id="gatsby-305-2">“Sorry you
                            didn’t win.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-306-1">That was for the golf tournament.</span><span id="gatsby-306-2">She had
                            lost in the finals the week before.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-307-1">“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we
                            met you here about a month ago.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-308-1">“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started, but
                            the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced
                            like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket.</span><span id="gatsby-308-2">With
                            Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the
                            garden.</span><span id="gatsby-308-3">A tray of cocktails floated at us through the
                            twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one
                            introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-309-1">“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl beside
                            her.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-310-1">“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an alert
                            confident voice.</span><span id="gatsby-310-2">She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for
                            you, Lucille?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-311-1">It was for Lucille, too.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-312-1">“I like to come,” Lucille said.</span><span id="gatsby-312-2">“I never
                            care what I do, so I always have a good time.</span><span id="gatsby-312-3">When I was here
                            last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a
                            package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-313-1">“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-314-1">“Sure I did.</span><span id="gatsby-314-2">I was going to wear it
                            tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-314-3">It was gas blue with lavender beads.</span><span id="gatsby-314-4">Two
                            hundred and sixty-five dollars.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-315-1">“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,”
                            said the other girl eagerly.</span><span id="gatsby-315-2">“He doesn’t want any trouble with
                            anybody.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-316-1">“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-317-1">“Gatsby.</span><span id="gatsby-317-2">Somebody told me—”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-318-1">The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-319-1">“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-320-1">A thrill passed over all of us.</span><span id="gatsby-320-2">The three
                            Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-321-1">“I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s
                            more that he was a German spy during the war.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-322-1">One of the men nodded in confirmation.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-323-1">“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in
                            Germany,” he assured us positively.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-324-1">“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in
                            the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward
                            with enthusiasm.</span><span id="gatsby-324-2">“You look at him sometimes when he thinks
                            nobody’s looking at him.</span><span id="gatsby-324-3">I’ll bet he killed a man.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-325-1">She narrowed her eyes and shivered.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-325-2">Lucille shivered.</span><span id="gatsby-325-3">We all turned and looked
                            around for Gatsby.</span><span id="gatsby-325-4">It was testimony to the romantic
                            speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little
                            that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-326-1">The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now being
                            served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the
                            other side of the garden.</span><span id="gatsby-326-2">There were three married couples and
                            Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under
                            the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater
                            or lesser degree.</span><span id="gatsby-326-3">Instead of rambling, this party had
                            preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the
                            staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard
                            against its spectroscopic gaiety.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-327-1">“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and
                            inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-328-1">We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had
                            never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy.</span><span id="gatsby-328-2">The
                            undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>

                            fashionably, and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing
                            individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the

                            id="gatsby-365-2">It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in

                            faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you

                        <span id="gatsby-382-1">The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it
                            began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group
                            to another with approving eyes.</span><span id="gatsby-382-2">His tanned skin was drawn
                            attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every
                            day.</span><span id="gatsby-382-3">I could see nothing sinister about him.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-382-4">I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from
                            his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity
                            increased.</span><span id="gatsby-382-5">When the “Jazz History of the World” was over,
                            girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were
                            swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would
                            arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s
                            shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.</span>

                            followed the butler toward the house.</span><span id="gatsby-388-2">I noticed that she wore
                            her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her
                            movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp
                            mornings.</span>

                            some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which
                            overhung the terrace.</span><span id="gatsby-389-3">Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was
                            now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to
                            join him, I went inside.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-390-1">The large room was full of people.</span><span id="gatsby-390-2">One of
                            the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young
                            lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song.</span><span id="gatsby-390-3">She had drunk a
                            quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that
                            everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-390-4">Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken
                            sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-390-5">The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came
                            into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour, and pursued the
                            rest of their way in slow black rivulets.</span><span id="gatsby-390-6">A humorous
                            suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands,
                            sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.</span>

                            appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: “You promised!” into his
                            ear.</span>

                            right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s
                            drive not two minutes before.</span><span id="gatsby-412-4">The sharp jut of a wall
                            accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from
                            half a dozen curious chauffeurs.</span><span id="gatsby-412-5">However, as they had left
                            their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been
                            audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-413-1">A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in
                            the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers
                            in a pleasant, puzzled way.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-414-1">“See!” he explained.</span><span id="gatsby-414-2">“It went in the
                            ditch.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-415-1">The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the
                            unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s
                            library.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-417-1">He shrugged his shoulders.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-418-1">“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-419-1">“But how did it happen?</span><span id="gatsby-419-2">Did you run into

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-420-1">“Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole

                        <span id="gatsby-422-1">“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even
                            trying.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-423-1">An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.</span>
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-426-1">“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-426-2">“I wasn’t driving.</span><span id="gatsby-426-3">There’s another man in

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-427-1">The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained
                            “Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open.</span><span id="gatsby-427-2">The
                            crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there
                            was a ghostly pause.</span><span id="gatsby-427-3">Then, very gradually, part by part, a
                            pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a
                            large uncertain dancing shoe.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-428-1">Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant
                            groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man
                            in the duster.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-429-1">“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly.</span><span id="gatsby-429-2">“Did
                            we run outa gas?”</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-431-1">Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for
                            a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the
                            sky.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-432-1">“It came off,” someone explained.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-433-1">He nodded.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-434-1">“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-435-1">A pause.</span><span id="gatsby-435-2">Then, taking a long breath and
                            straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-436-1">“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-437-1">At least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was,
                            explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-438-1">“Back out,” he suggested after a moment.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-438-2">“Put her in reverse.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-439-1">“But the wheel’s off!”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-440-1">He hesitated.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-441-1">“No harm in trying,” he said.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-442-1">The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut
                            across the lawn toward home.</span><span id="gatsby-442-2">I glanced back once.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-442-3">A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine
                            as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-442-4">A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great
                            doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his
                            hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-443-1">Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the
                            impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed
                            me.</span><span id="gatsby-443-2">On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a
                            crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal
                            affairs.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-444-1">Most of the time I worked.</span><span id="gatsby-444-2">In the early
                            morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New
                            York to the Probity Trust.</span><span id="gatsby-444-3">I knew the other clerks and young
                            bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on
                            little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee.</span><span id="gatsby-444-4">I even had
                            a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department,
                            but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation
                            in July I let it blow quietly away.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-445-1">I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the
                            gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments
                            and securities for a conscientious hour.</span><span id="gatsby-445-2">There were generally
                            a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to
                            work.</span><span id="gatsby-445-3">After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down
                            Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania
                            Station.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-446-1">I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and
                            the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the
                            restless eye.</span><span id="gatsby-446-2">I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out
                            romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into
                            their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-446-3">Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners
                            of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door
                            into warm darkness.</span><span id="gatsby-446-4">At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I
                            felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered
                            in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks
                            in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-447-1">Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined
                            five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my
                            heart.</span><span id="gatsby-447-2">Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and
                            voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made
                            unintelligible circles inside.</span><span id="gatsby-447-3">Imagining that I, too, was
                            hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-448-1">For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found
                            her again.</span><span id="gatsby-448-2">At first I was flattered to go places with her,
                            because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-448-3">Then it was something more.</span><span id="gatsby-448-4">I wasn’t
                            actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity.</span><span id="gatsby-448-5">The
                            bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations
                            conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found
                            what it was.</span><span id="gatsby-448-6">When we were on a house-party together up in
                            Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about
                            it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at
                            Daisy’s.</span><span id="gatsby-448-7">At her first big golf tournament there was a row that
                            nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the
                            semifinal round.</span><span id="gatsby-448-8">The thing approached the proportions of a
                            scandal—then died away.</span><span id="gatsby-448-9">A caddy retracted his statement, and
                            the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-448-10">The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-449-1">Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw
                            that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be
                            thought impossible.</span><span id="gatsby-449-2">She was incurably dishonest.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-449-3">She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this
                            unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in
                            order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of
                            her hard, jaunty body.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-522-1">“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand
                            earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-523-1">“What?” I inquired politely.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-524-1">But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and
                            covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-525-1">“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh,
                            don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and there.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-526-1">Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant,
                            whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a
                            somnambulatory abstraction.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-527-1">“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-528-1">“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the
                            presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling.</span><span id="gatsby-528-2">“But I like across the

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-529-1">“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too
                            hot over there.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-530-1">“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-531-1">“What place is that?” I asked.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-533-1">“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily.</span><span

                            Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-535-1">“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-536-1">“Did he go?” I asked innocently.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-537-1">“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me
                            indignantly.</span><span id="gatsby-537-2">“He turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t
                            let that waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him
                            three times in his full belly and drove away.”</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-538-1">“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-539-1">“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested

                        <span id="gatsby-540-1">The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-540-2">Gatsby answered for me:</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-541-1">“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-542-1">“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-543-1">“This is just a friend.</span><span id="gatsby-543-2">I told you we’d

                        <span id="gatsby-544-1">“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-545-1">A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more
                            sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious
                            delicacy.</span><span id="gatsby-545-2">His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around
                            the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-545-3">I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance
                            beneath our own table.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-546-1">“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I

                        <span id="gatsby-547-1">There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-548-1">“I don’t like mysteries,” I answered, “and I don’t understand why you

                        <span id="gatsby-549-1">“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-549-2">“Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-550-1">Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room,

                            would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-590-1">(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a
                            straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-591-1">—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks
                            and half on the lawns.</span><span id="gatsby-591-2">I was happier on the lawns because I
                            had on shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft
                            ground.</span><span id="gatsby-591-3">I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in
                            the wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in front of all the
                            houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-592-1">The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to
                            Daisy Fay’s house.</span><span id="gatsby-592-2">She was just eighteen, two years older than
                            me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-592-3">She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long
                            the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the
                            privilege of monopolizing her that night.</span><span id="gatsby-592-4">“Anyways, for an
                            hour!”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-593-1">When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was
                            beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen
                            before.</span><span id="gatsby-593-2">They were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t
                            see me until I was five feet away.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-594-1">“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-594-2">“Please come here.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-595-1">I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older
                            girls I admired her most.</span><span id="gatsby-595-2">She asked me if I was going to the
                            Red Cross to make bandages.</span><span id="gatsby-595-3">I was.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-595-4">Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day?</span><span
                            id="gatsby-595-5">The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every
                            young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have
                            remembered the incident ever since.</span><span id="gatsby-595-6">His name was Jay Gatsby,
                            and I didn’t lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island
                            I didn’t realize it was the same man.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-596-1">That was nineteen-seventeen.</span><span id="gatsby-596-2">By the next
                            year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy
                            very often.</span><span id="gatsby-596-3">She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went
                            with anyone at all.</span><span id="gatsby-596-4">Wild rumours were circulating about
                            her—how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say
                            goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas.</span><span id="gatsby-596-5">She was
                            effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for several
                            weeks.</span><span id="gatsby-596-6">After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any
                            more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town, who couldn’t get into
                            the army at all.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-597-1">By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-597-2">She had a début after the armistice, and in February she was presumably
                            engaged to a man from New Orleans.</span><span id="gatsby-597-3">In June she married Tom
                            Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew
                            before.</span><span id="gatsby-597-4">He came down with a hundred people in four private
                            cars, and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave
                            her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-598-1">I was a bridesmaid.</span><span id="gatsby-598-2">I came into her room
                            half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June
                            night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey.</span><span id="gatsby-598-3">She had
                            a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-599-1">“ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered.</span><span id="gatsby-599-2">“Never had
                            a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.”</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-600-1">“What’s the matter, Daisy?”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-601-1">I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that
                            before.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-602-1">“Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on
                            the bed and pulled out the string of pearls.</span><span id="gatsby-602-2">“Take ’em
                            downstairs and give ’em back to whoever they belong to.</span><span id="gatsby-602-3">Tell
                            ’em all Daisy’s change’ her mine.</span><span id="gatsby-602-4">Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her
                            mine!’ ”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-603-1">She began to cry—she cried and cried.</span><span id="gatsby-603-2">I
                            rushed out and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold
                            bath.</span><span id="gatsby-603-3">She wouldn’t let go of the letter.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-603-4">She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and
                            only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like
                            snow.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-604-1">But she didn’t say another word.</span><span id="gatsby-604-2">We gave
                            her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and
                            half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the
                            incident was over.</span><span id="gatsby-604-3">Next day at five o’clock she married Tom
                            Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South
                            Seas.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-605-1">I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d never
                            seen a girl so mad about her husband.</span><span id="gatsby-605-2">If he left the room for
                            a minute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and wear the most
                            abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-605-3">She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing
                            her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-605-4">It was touching to see them together—it made you laugh in a hushed,
                            fascinated way.</span><span id="gatsby-605-5">That was in August.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-605-6">A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road
                            one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car.</span><span id="gatsby-605-7">The girl who
                            was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the
                            chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-606-1">The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a
                            year.</span><span id="gatsby-606-2">I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville,
                            and then they came back to Chicago to settle down.</span><span id="gatsby-606-3">Daisy was
                            popular in Chicago, as you know.</span><span id="gatsby-606-4">They moved with a fast crowd,
                            all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect
                            reputation.</span><span id="gatsby-606-5">Perhaps because she doesn’t drink.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-606-6">It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking
                            people.</span><span id="gatsby-606-7">You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time
                            any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don’t see
                            or care.</span><span id="gatsby-606-8">Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet
                            there’s something in that voice of hers…</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-607-1">Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time
                            in years.</span><span id="gatsby-607-2">It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew
                            Gatsby in West Egg.</span><span id="gatsby-607-3">After you had gone home she came into my

                            said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know.</span><span

                            eleven o’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said
                            that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass.</span><span id="gatsby-663-3">This
                            reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg
                            Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and
                            flowers.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-664-1">The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived
                            from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it.</span><span id="gatsby-664-2">An
                            hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver
                            shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in.</span><span id="gatsby-664-3">He was pale, and
                            there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-665-1">“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-667-1">“What grass?” he inquired blankly.</span><span id="gatsby-667-2">“Oh,
                            the grass in the yard.” He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I
                            don’t believe he saw a thing.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-668-1">“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-668-2">“One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about

                        <span id="gatsby-669-1">I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at
                            the Finn.</span><span id="gatsby-669-2">Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from
                            the delicatessen shop.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-670-1">“Will they do?” I asked.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-671-1">“Of course, of course!</span><span id="gatsby-671-2">They’re fine!” and
                            he added hollowly, “… old sport.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-672-1">The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which
                            occasional thin drops swam like dew.</span><span id="gatsby-672-2">Gatsby looked with vacant
                            eyes through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the
                            kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of
                            invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-672-3">Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was
                            going home.</span>

                            He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time
                            elsewhere.</span><span id="gatsby-674-3">“I can’t wait all day.”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-676-1">He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there

                            streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with

                            id="gatsby-693-2">His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct
                            mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was
                            sitting, frightened but graceful, on the edge of a stiff chair.</span>

                            at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and
                            set it back in place.</span><span id="gatsby-694-4">Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on
                            the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-701-1">The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least
                            another minute.</span><span id="gatsby-701-2">I had them both on their feet with the
                            desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn
                            brought it in on a tray.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-702-1">Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency
                            established itself.</span><span id="gatsby-702-2">Gatsby got himself into a shadow and,
                            while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense,
                            unhappy eyes.</span><span id="gatsby-702-3">However, as calmness wasn’t an end in itself, I
                            made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my feet.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-703-1">“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-704-1">“I’ll be back.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-705-1">“I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-706-1">He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered:
                            “Oh, God!” in a miserable way.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-707-1">“What’s the matter?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-708-1">“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to
                            side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-709-1">“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s
                            embarrassed too.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-710-1">“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-711-1">“Just as much as you are.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-712-1">“Don’t talk so loud.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-713-1">“You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-713-2">“Not only that, but you’re rude.</span><span id="gatsby-713-3">Daisy’s
                            sitting in there all alone.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-714-1">He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable
                            reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other room.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-715-1">I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his
                            nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge black knotted tree,
                            whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain.</span><span id="gatsby-715-2">Once more
                            it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small
                            muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes.</span><span id="gatsby-715-3">There was nothing to
                            look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at
                            his church steeple, for half an hour.</span><span id="gatsby-715-4">A brewer had built it
                            early in the “period” craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay
                            five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs
                            thatched with straw.</span><span id="gatsby-715-5">Perhaps their refusal took the heart out
                            of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate decline.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-715-6">His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the
                            door.</span><span id="gatsby-715-7">Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have
                            always been obstinate about being peasantry.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-716-1">After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile
                            rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure he
                            wouldn’t eat a spoonful.</span><span id="gatsby-716-2">A maid began opening the upper
                            windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from the large central bay,
                            spat meditatively into the garden.</span><span id="gatsby-716-3">It was time I went
                            back.</span><span id="gatsby-716-4">While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur
                            of their voices, rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of
                            emotion.</span><span id="gatsby-716-5">But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen
                            within the house too.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-717-1">I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of
                            pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-717-2">They were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if
                            some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was
                            gone.</span><span id="gatsby-717-3">Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when I came in
                            she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-717-4">But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-717-5">He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new
                            well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-718-1">“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for
                            years.</span><span id="gatsby-718-2">I thought for a moment he was going to shake
                            hands.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-719-1">“It’s stopped raining.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-720-1">“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were
                            twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron
                            of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy.</span><span id="gatsby-720-2">“What do
                            you think of that?</span><span id="gatsby-720-3">It’s stopped raining.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-721-1">“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only
                            of her unexpected joy.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-722-1">“I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to
                            show her around.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-723-1">“You’re sure you want me to come?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-724-1">“Absolutely, old sport.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-725-1">Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with humiliation
                            of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-726-1">“My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-726-2">“See how the whole front of it catches the light.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-727-1">I agreed that it was splendid.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-728-1">“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square
                            tower.</span><span id="gatsby-728-2">“It took me just three years to earn the money that
                            bought it.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-729-1">“I thought you inherited your money.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-730-1">“I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in the
                            big panic—the panic of the war.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-731-1">I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what
                            business he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized that it wasn’t an
                            appropriate reply.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-732-1">“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-732-2">“I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil
                            business.</span><span id="gatsby-732-3">But I’m not in either one now.” He looked at me with
                            more attention.</span><span id="gatsby-732-4">“Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I
                            proposed the other night?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-733-1">Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass
                            buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-734-1">“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-735-1">“Do you like it?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-736-1">“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-737-1">“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-737-2">People who do interesting things.</span><span id="gatsby-737-3">Celebrated
                            people.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-738-1">Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road
                            and entered by the big postern.</span><span id="gatsby-738-2">With enchanting murmurs Daisy
                            admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens,
                            the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the
                            pale gold odour of kiss-me-at-the-gate.</span><span id="gatsby-738-3">It was strange to
                            reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no
                            sound but bird voices in the trees.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-739-1">And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and
                            Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table,
                            under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-739-2">As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College Library” I could have
                            sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-740-1">We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender
                            silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with
                            sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver
                            exercises on the floor.</span><span id="gatsby-740-2">It was Mr. Klipspringer, the
                            “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-740-3">Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an
                            Adam’s study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard
                            in the wall.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-741-1">He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued
                            everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved
                            eyes.</span><span id="gatsby-741-2">Sometimes too, he stared around at his possessions in a
                            dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer
                            real.</span><span id="gatsby-741-3">Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-742-1">His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was
                            garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold.</span><span id="gatsby-742-2">Daisy took the
                            brush with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and
                            began to laugh.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-744-1">He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a
                            third.</span><span id="gatsby-744-2">After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was
                            consumed with wonder at her presence.</span><span id="gatsby-744-3">He had been full of the
                            idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak,
                            at an inconceivable pitch of intensity.</span><span id="gatsby-744-4">Now, in the reaction,
                            he was running down like an over-wound clock.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-745-1">Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent
                            cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like
                            bricks in stacks a dozen high.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-747-1">He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before
                            us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they
                            fell and covered the table in many-coloured disarray.</span><span id="gatsby-747-2">While we
                            admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and
                            scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of
                            indian blue.</span><span id="gatsby-747-3">Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her
                            head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-748-1">“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the
                            thick folds.</span><span id="gatsby-748-2">“It makes me sad because I’ve never seen

                            the hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window it began to rain
                            again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-751-1">Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what
                            he had just said.</span><span id="gatsby-751-2">Possibly it had occurred to him that the
                            colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-751-3">Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had
                            seemed very near to her, almost touching her.</span><span id="gatsby-751-4">It had seemed as
                            close as a star to the moon.</span><span id="gatsby-751-5">Now it was again a green light on
                            a dock.</span><span id="gatsby-751-6">His count of enchanted objects had diminished by

                            the half darkness.</span><span id="gatsby-752-2">A large photograph of an elderly man in
                            yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-757-1">There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the

                            eighteen.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-766-1">I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence

                            sat down with her on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the

                            over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-783-1">They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;
                            Gatsby didn’t know me now at all.</span><span id="gatsby-783-2">I looked once more at them
                            and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-783-3">Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain,
                            leaving them there together.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-784-1">VI
                            About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s
                            door and asked him if he had anything to say.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-785-1">“Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-786-1">“Why—any statement to give out.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-787-1">It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard
                            Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn’t reveal or didn’t
                            fully understand.</span><span id="gatsby-787-2">This was his day off and with laudable
                            initiative he had hurried out “to see.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-788-1">It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was
                            right.</span><span id="gatsby-788-2">Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who
                            had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities upon his past, had increased all
                            summer until he fell just short of being news.</span><span id="gatsby-788-3">Contemporary
                            legends such as the “underground pipeline to Canada” attached themselves to him, and there
                            was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked
                            like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-788-4">Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of
                            North Dakota, isn’t easy to say.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-789-1">James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-789-2">He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that
                            witnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most
                            insidious flat on Lake Superior.</span><span id="gatsby-789-3">It was James Gatz who had
                            been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas
                            pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and
                            informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-790-1">I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even
                            then.</span><span id="gatsby-790-2">His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm
                            people—his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-790-3">The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his
                            Platonic conception of himself.</span><span id="gatsby-790-4">He was a son of God—a phrase
                            which, if it means anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s business, the
                            service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty.</span><span id="gatsby-790-5">So he
                            invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to
                            invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-791-1">For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of
                            Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other capacity that brought him
                            food and bed.</span><span id="gatsby-791-2">His brown, hardening body lived naturally
                            through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-791-3">He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of
                            them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were
                            hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for
                            granted.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-792-1">But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-792-2">The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at
                            night.</span><span id="gatsby-792-3">A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in
                            his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his
                            tangled clothes upon the floor.</span><span id="gatsby-792-4">Each night he added to the
                            pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious
                            embrace.</span><span id="gatsby-792-5">For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his
                            imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the
                            rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-793-1">An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to
                            the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-793-2">He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the
                            drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which he was
                            to pay his way through.</span><span id="gatsby-793-3">Then he drifted back to Lake Superior,
                            and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped
                            anchor in the shallows alongshore.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-794-1">Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of
                            the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five.</span><span id="gatsby-794-2">The
                            transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically
                            robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of
                            women tried to separate him from his money.</span><span id="gatsby-794-3">The none too
                            savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to
                            his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid journalism
                            in 1902.</span><span id="gatsby-794-4">He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores
                            for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny in Little Girl Bay.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-795-1">To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck,
                            that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-795-2">I suppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked
                            him when he smiled.</span><span id="gatsby-795-3">At any rate Cody asked him a few questions
                            (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and extravagantly
                            ambitious.</span><span id="gatsby-795-4">A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought
                            him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-795-5">And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast,
                            Gatsby left too.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-796-1">He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with Cody
                            he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew
                            what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about, and he provided for such
                            contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby.</span><span id="gatsby-796-2">The
                            arrangement lasted five years, during which the boat went three times around the
                            Continent.</span><span id="gatsby-796-3">It might have lasted indefinitely except for the
                            fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably
                            died.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-797-1">I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a grey, florid
                            man with a hard, empty face—the pioneer debauchee, who during one phase of American life
                            brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and
                            saloon.</span><span id="gatsby-797-2">It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so
                            little.</span><span id="gatsby-797-3">Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to
                            rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-798-1">And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five
                            thousand dollars.</span><span id="gatsby-798-2">He didn’t get it.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-798-3">He never understood the legal device that was used against him, but what
                            remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye.</span><span id="gatsby-798-4">He was left
                            with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to
                            the substantiality of a man.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-799-1">He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with the
                            idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents, which weren’t even faintly
                            true.</span><span id="gatsby-799-2">Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I
                            had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-799-3">So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught
                            his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-800-1">It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-800-2">For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I
                            was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile
                            aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-800-3">I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for
                            a drink.</span><span id="gatsby-800-4">I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising
                            thing was that it hadn’t happened before.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-801-1">They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a
                            pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-802-1">“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his
                            porch.</span><span id="gatsby-802-2">“I’m delighted that you dropped in.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-803-1">As though they cared!</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-804-1">“Sit right down.</span><span id="gatsby-804-2">Have a cigarette or a
                            cigar.” He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-804-3">“I’ll have something to drink for you in just a minute.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-805-1">He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-805-2">But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing
                            in a vague way that that was all they came for.</span><span id="gatsby-805-3">Mr. Sloane
                            wanted nothing.</span><span id="gatsby-805-4">A lemonade?</span><span id="gatsby-805-5">No,
                            thanks.</span><span id="gatsby-805-6">A little champagne?</span><span
                            id="gatsby-805-7">Nothing at all, thanks… I’m sorry—</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-806-1">“Did you have a nice ride?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-807-1">“Very good roads around here.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-808-1">“I suppose the automobiles—”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-809-1">“Yeah.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-810-1">Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted

                            haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until unexpectedly, after two

                        <span id="gatsby-831-1">“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-832-1">“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-833-1">Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-834-1">“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-835-1">“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby.</span><span id="gatsby-835-2">“I
                            used to ride in the army, but I’ve never bought a horse.</span><span id="gatsby-835-3">I’ll

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-836-1">The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began
                            an impassioned conversation aside.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-837-1">“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-837-2">“Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-838-1">“She says she does want him.”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-839-1">“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He
                            frowned.</span><span id="gatsby-839-2">“I wonder where in the devil he met
                            Daisy.</span><span id="gatsby-839-3">By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-840-1">Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their
                            horses.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-841-1">“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-841-2">We’ve got to go.” And then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will
                            you?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-842-1">Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they
                            trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, with
                            hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-843-1">Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the
                            following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-843-2">Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of
                            oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties that
                            summer.</span><span id="gatsby-843-3">There were the same people, or at least the same sort
                            of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured, many-keyed commotion,
                            but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there
                            before.</span><span id="gatsby-843-4">Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to
                            accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great
                            figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was
                            looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes.</span><span id="gatsby-843-5">It is invariably
                            saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of
                            adjustment.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-844-1">They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling
                            hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-845-1">“These things excite me so,” she whispered.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-845-2">“If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me
                            know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you.</span><span id="gatsby-845-3">Just mention my
                            name.</span><span id="gatsby-845-4">Or present a green card.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-845-5">I’m giving out green—”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-846-1">“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-847-1">“I’m looking around.</span><span id="gatsby-847-2">I’m having a

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-849-1">Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-850-1">“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking I
                            don’t know a soul here.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-851-1">“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely
                            human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-851-2">Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies
                            the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-852-1">“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-853-1">“The man bending over her is her director.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-854-1">He took them ceremoniously from group to group:</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-855-1">“Mrs.</span><span id="gatsby-855-2">Buchanan… and Mr. Buchanan—” After
                            an instant’s hesitation he added: “the polo player.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-856-1">“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-857-1">But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the polo
                            player” for the rest of the evening.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-858-1">“I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-858-2">“I liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-859-1">Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-860-1">“Well, I liked him anyhow.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-861-1">“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly, “I’d
                            rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-862-1">Daisy and Gatsby danced.</span><span id="gatsby-862-2">I remember being
                            surprised by his graceful, conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance

                            together.</span><span id="gatsby-863-2">“Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?”
                            he said.</span><span id="gatsby-863-3">“A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-864-1">“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any
                            addresses here’s my little gold pencil.”… She looked around after a moment and told me the
                            girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that except for the half-hour she’d been alone with
                            Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-865-1">We were at a particularly tipsy table.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-865-2">That was my fault—Gatsby had been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed
                            these same people only two weeks before.</span><span id="gatsby-865-3">But what had amused
                            me then turned septic on the air now.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-866-1">“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-867-1">The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my
                            shoulder.</span><span id="gatsby-867-2">At this inquiry she sat up and opened her
                            eyes.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-868-1">“Wha’?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-869-1">A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf
                            with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-870-1">“Oh, she’s all right now.</span><span id="gatsby-870-2">When she’s had
                            five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that.</span><span id="gatsby-870-3">I
                            tell her she ought to leave it alone.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-871-1">“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-872-1">“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody
                            that needs your help, Doc.’ ”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-873-1">“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without gratitude,
                            “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-874-1">“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss
                            Baedeker.</span><span id="gatsby-874-2">“They almost drowned me once over in New
                            Jersey.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-875-1">“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-876-1">“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-876-2">“Your hand shakes.</span><span id="gatsby-876-3">I wouldn’t let you
                            operate on me!”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-877-1">It was like that.</span><span id="gatsby-877-2">Almost the last thing I
                            remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his
                            Star.</span><span id="gatsby-877-3">They were still under the white-plum tree and their
                            faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-877-4">It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all
                            evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate
                            degree and kiss at her cheek.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-878-1">“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-879-1">But the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture but
                            an emotion.</span><span id="gatsby-879-2">She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented
                            “place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw
                            vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its
                            inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing.</span><span id="gatsby-879-3">She saw
                            something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-880-1">I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their
                            car.</span><span id="gatsby-880-2">It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten
                            square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-880-3">Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to
                            another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible
                            glass.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-881-1">“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-881-2">“Some big bootlegger?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-882-1">“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-883-1">“I didn’t hear it.</span><span id="gatsby-883-2">I imagined
                            it.</span><span id="gatsby-883-3">A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers,
                            you know.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-884-1">“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-885-1">He was silent for a moment.</span><span id="gatsby-885-2">The pebbles of
                            the drive crunched under his feet.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-886-1">“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie
                            together.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-887-1">A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-888-1">“At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said
                            with an effort.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-889-1">“You didn’t look so interested.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-890-1">“Well, I was.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-891-1">Tom laughed and turned to me.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-892-1">“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under a
                            cold shower?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-893-1">Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,
                            bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have
                            again.</span><span id="gatsby-893-2">When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly,
                            following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her
                            warm human magic upon the air.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-894-1">“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said
                            suddenly.</span><span id="gatsby-894-2">“That girl hadn’t been invited.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-894-3">They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-895-1">“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-895-2">“And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-896-1">“I can tell you right now,” she answered.</span><span

                            id="gatsby-896-3">He built them up himself.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-897-1">The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-898-1">“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-899-1">Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where “Three
                            O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open
                            door.</span><span id="gatsby-899-2">After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party
                            there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-899-3">What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back

                            hours?</span><span id="gatsby-899-5">Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person
                            infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one
                            fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of
                            unwavering devotion.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-900-1">I stayed late that night.</span><span id="gatsby-900-2">Gatsby asked me
                            to wait until he was free, and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party
                            had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in
                            the guestrooms overhead.</span><span id="gatsby-900-3">When he came down the steps at last
                            the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and

                        <span id="gatsby-905-1">“I feel far away from her,” he said.</span><span id="gatsby-905-2">“It’s

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-913-1">He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the
                            shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-914-1">“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said,

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-915-1">He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover
                            something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-915-2">His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once
                            return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that
                            thing was…</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-916-1">… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the
                            street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and
                            the sidewalk was white with moonlight.</span><span id="gatsby-916-2">They stopped here and
                            turned toward each other.</span><span id="gatsby-916-3">Now it was a cool night with that
                            mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-916-4">The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and
                            there was a stir and bustle among the stars.</span><span id="gatsby-916-5">Out of the corner
                            of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to
                            a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he
                            could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-917-1">His heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his
                            own.</span><span id="gatsby-917-2">He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed
                            his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the
                            mind of God.</span><span id="gatsby-917-3">So he waited, listening for a moment longer to
                            the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star.</span><span id="gatsby-917-4">Then he
                            kissed her.</span><span id="gatsby-917-5">At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a
                            flower and the incarnation was complete.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-918-1">Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was
                            reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard
                            somewhere a long time ago.</span><span id="gatsby-918-2">For a moment a phrase tried to take
                            shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more struggling
                            upon them than a wisp of startled air.</span><span id="gatsby-918-3">But they made no sound,
                            and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-919-1">VII
                            It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to
                            go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was
                            over.</span><span id="gatsby-919-2">Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles
                            which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily
                            away.</span><span id="gatsby-919-3">Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out—an
                            unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-921-1">“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir” in a dilatory, grudging way.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-922-1">“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried.</span><span

                        <span id="gatsby-926-1">Abruptly he slammed the door.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-927-1">My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house
                            a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg village
                            to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-927-2">The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the
                            general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-928-1">Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.</span>

                            id="gatsby-936-5">And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a
                            scene—especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the

                            combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist,
                            and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat
                            with a desolate cry.</span><span id="gatsby-937-4">Her pocketbook slapped to the

                        <span id="gatsby-954-1">We were silent.</span><span id="gatsby-954-2">The voice in the hall rose
                            high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all… I’m under no
                            obligations to you at all… and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won’t
                            stand that at all!”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-955-1">“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-956-1">“No, he’s not,” I assured her.</span><span id="gatsby-956-2">“It’s a

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-957-1">Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his
                            thick body, and hurried into the room.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-958-1">“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed

                        <span id="gatsby-960-1">As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled
                            his face down, kissing him on the mouth.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-961-1">“You know I love you,” she murmured.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-962-1">“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-966-1">“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick
                            fireplace.</span><span id="gatsby-966-2">Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily
                            on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the

                        <span id="gatsby-968-1">The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted
                            shyly into her mother’s dress.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-969-1">“The bles-sed pre-cious!</span><span id="gatsby-969-2">Did mother get

                        <span id="gatsby-970-1">Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant

                            surprise.</span><span id="gatsby-970-3">I don’t think he had ever really believed in its

                        <span id="gatsby-971-1">“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to

                        <span id="gatsby-973-1">“Yes,” admitted the child calmly.</span><span id="gatsby-973-2">“Aunt

                        <span id="gatsby-974-1">“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that she

                        <span id="gatsby-977-1">Daisy sat back upon the couch.</span><span id="gatsby-977-2">The nurse

                        <span id="gatsby-980-1">With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her

                            moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on
                            Tom.</span><span id="gatsby-1077-2">He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life

                            than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in
                            intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the

                        <span id="gatsby-1079-1">That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare
                            of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something

                        <span id="gatsby-1080-1">In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside
                            a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car.</span><span id="gatsby-1080-2">So
                            engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after
                            another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1080-3">Her expression was curiously familiar—it was an expression I had often
                            seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable
                            until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on
                            Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.</span>

                            drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.</span><span id="gatsby-1081-2">His wife
                            and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from

                            the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward
                            Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in
                            sight of the easygoing blue coupé.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-1082-1">“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested

                        <span id="gatsby-1083-1">The word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but
                            before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to draw up
                            alongside.</span>

                            wit rose faintly.</span><span id="gatsby-1086-4">“We’ll meet you on some corner.</span><span

                        <span id="gatsby-1088-1">Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if
                            the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1088-2">I think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his

                        <span id="gatsby-1089-1">But they didn’t.</span><span id="gatsby-1089-2">And we all took the

                        <span id="gatsby-1090-1">The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into
                            that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my
                            underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat
                            raced cool across my back.</span><span id="gatsby-1090-2">The notion originated with Daisy’s
                            suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible
                            form as “a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it was a “crazy
                            idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we
                            were being very funny…</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-1091-1">The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four
                            o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the
                            Park.</span><span id="gatsby-1091-2">Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,

                        <span id="gatsby-1093-1">“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.</span>

                            id="gatsby-1205-2">Gatsby said nothing.</span><span id="gatsby-1205-3">“Walter could have
                            you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1206-1">That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s
                            face.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1207-1">“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly,
                            “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1208-1">I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her
                            husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the
                            tip of her chin.</span><span id="gatsby-1208-2">Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was
                            startled at his expression.</span><span id="gatsby-1208-3">He looked—and this is said in all
                            contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had “killed a man.” For a moment the
                            set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1209-1">It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything,
                            defending his name against accusations that had not been made.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1209-2">But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so
                            he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to
                            touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost
                            voice across the room.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1210-1">The voice begged again to go.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1211-1">“Please, Tom!</span><span id="gatsby-1211-2">I can’t stand this any
                            more.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1212-1">Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage she
                            had had, were definitely gone.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1213-1">“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1213-2">“In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1214-1">She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous
                            scorn.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1215-1">“Go on.</span><span id="gatsby-1215-2">He won’t annoy you.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1215-3">I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1216-1">They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated,
                            like ghosts, even from our pity.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1217-1">After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of
                            whisky in the towel.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1218-1">“Want any of this stuff?</span><span id="gatsby-1218-2">Jordan?…

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1219-1">I didn’t answer.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1220-1">“Nick?” He asked again.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1221-1">“What?”</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-1222-1">“Want any?”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-1223-1">“No… I just remembered that today’s my birthday.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1224-1">I was thirty.</span><span id="gatsby-1224-2">Before me stretched the
                            portentous, menacing road of a new decade.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1225-1">It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started
                            for Long Island.</span><span id="gatsby-1225-2">Tom talked incessantly, exulting and
                            laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on the
                            sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead.</span><span id="gatsby-1225-3">Human
                            sympathy has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the
                            city lights behind.</span><span id="gatsby-1225-4">Thirty—the promise of a decade of
                            loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm,
                            thinning hair.</span><span id="gatsby-1225-5">But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike
                            Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1225-6">As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my
                            coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure
                            of her hand.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1226-1">So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1227-1">The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the
                            ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest.</span><span id="gatsby-1227-2">He had
                            slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found
                            George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all
                            over.</span><span id="gatsby-1227-3">Michaelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused,
                            saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did.</span><span id="gatsby-1227-4">While his
                            neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1228-1">“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson
                            calmly.</span><span id="gatsby-1228-2">“She’s going to stay there till the day after
                            tomorrow, and then we’re going to move away.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1229-1">Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and
                            Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1229-2">Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he
                            sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the
                            road.</span><span id="gatsby-1229-3">When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an
                            agreeable, colourless way.</span><span id="gatsby-1229-4">He was his wife’s man and not his
                            own.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1230-1">So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson
                            wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and
                            ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1230-2">Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door
                            bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come
                            back later.</span><span id="gatsby-1230-3">But he didn’t.</span><span id="gatsby-1230-4">He
                            supposed he forgot to, that’s all.</span><span id="gatsby-1230-5">When he came outside
                            again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard
                            Mrs.</span><span id="gatsby-1230-6">Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the
                            garage.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1231-1">“Beat me!” he heard her cry.</span><span id="gatsby-1231-2">“Throw me
                            down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1232-1">A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and
                            shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1233-1">The “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out
                            of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the
                            next bend.</span><span id="gatsby-1233-2">Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its colour—he
                            told the first policeman that it was light green.</span><span id="gatsby-1233-3">The other
                            car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver
                            hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and
                            mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1234-1">Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open
                            her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging
                            loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1234-2">The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners, as though she
                            had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1235-1">We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still
                            some distance away.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1236-1">“Wreck!” said Tom.</span><span id="gatsby-1236-2">“That’s
                            good.</span><span id="gatsby-1236-3">Wilson’ll have a little business at last.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1237-1">He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as
                            we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him
                            automatically put on the brakes.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1238-1">“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1239-1">I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly
                            from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door
                            resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1240-1">“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1241-1">He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the
                            garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket
                            overhead.</span><span id="gatsby-1241-2">Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with
                            a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1242-1">The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it
                            was a minute before I could see anything at all.</span><span id="gatsby-1242-2">Then new
                            arrivals deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1243-1">Myrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another
                            blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on a worktable by the
                            wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1243-2">Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much
                            sweat and correction in a little book.</span><span id="gatsby-1243-3">At first I couldn’t
                            find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare
                            garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and
                            forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands.</span><span id="gatsby-1243-4">Some man
                            was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his
                            shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw.</span><span id="gatsby-1243-5">His eyes would
                            drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk back to
                            the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high, horrible call:</span>

                            garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-1267-1">“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was!</span><span

                        <span id="gatsby-1341-1">He wouldn’t consider it.</span><span id="gatsby-1341-2">He couldn’t
                            possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1341-3">He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn’t bear to shake him
                            free.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1342-1">It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with
                            Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard
                            malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played out.</span><span id="gatsby-1342-2">I
                            think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk
                            about Daisy.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1343-1">She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1343-2">In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people,
                            but always with indiscernible barbed wire between.</span><span id="gatsby-1343-3">He found
                            her excitingly desirable.</span><span id="gatsby-1343-4">He went to her house, at first with
                            other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone.</span><span id="gatsby-1343-5">It amazed him—he
                            had never been in such a beautiful house before.</span><span id="gatsby-1343-6">But what
                            gave it an air of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing
                            to her as his tent out at camp was to him.</span><span id="gatsby-1343-7">There was a ripe
                            mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms,
                            of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were
                            not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this
                            year’s shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1343-8">It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased
                            her value in his eyes.</span><span id="gatsby-1343-9">He felt their presence all about the
                            house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1344-1">But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal
                            accident.</span><span id="gatsby-1344-2">However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby,
                            he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible
                            cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders.</span><span id="gatsby-1344-3">So he
                            made the most of his time.</span><span id="gatsby-1344-4">He took what he could get,
                            ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her
                            because he had no real right to touch her hand.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1345-1">He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under
                            false pretences.</span><span id="gatsby-1345-2">I don’t mean that he had traded on his
                            phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her
                            believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself—that he was fully able to
                            take care of her.</span><span id="gatsby-1345-3">As a matter of fact, he had no such
                            facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim
                            of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1346-1">But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had
                            imagined.</span><span id="gatsby-1346-2">He had intended, probably, to take what he could
                            and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a
                            grail.</span><span id="gatsby-1346-3">He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t
                            realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be.</span><span id="gatsby-1346-4">She
                            vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1346-5">He felt married to her, that was all.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1347-1">When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless,
                            who was, somehow, betrayed.</span><span id="gatsby-1347-2">Her porch was bright with the
                            bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned
                            toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.</span><span id="gatsby-1347-3">She
                            had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was
                            overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the
                            freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot
                            struggles of the poor.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1348-1">“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,
                            old sport.</span><span id="gatsby-1348-2">I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over,
                            but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too.</span><span id="gatsby-1348-3">She
                            thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her… Well, there I was, way off my
                            ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t
                            care.</span><span id="gatsby-1348-4">What was the use of doing great things if I could have
                            a better time telling her what I was going to do?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1349-1">On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his
                            arms for a long, silent time.</span><span id="gatsby-1349-2">It was a cold fall day, with
                            fire in the room and her cheeks flushed.</span><span id="gatsby-1349-3">Now and then she
                            moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1349-4">The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a
                            deep memory for the long parting the next day promised.</span><span id="gatsby-1349-5">They
                            had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with
                            another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched
                            the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1350-1">He did extraordinarily well in the war.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1350-2">He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne
                            battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1350-3">After the armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some
                            complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1350-4">He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s
                            letters.</span><span id="gatsby-1350-5">She didn’t see why he couldn’t come.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1350-6">She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see
                            him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing
                            after all.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1351-1">For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids
                            and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up
                            the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes.</span><span id="gatsby-1351-2">All
                            night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred
                            pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1351-3">At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly
                            with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown
                            by the sad horns around the floor.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1352-1">Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the
                            season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and
                            drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying
                            orchids on the floor beside her bed.</span><span id="gatsby-1352-2">And all the time
                            something within her was crying for a decision.</span><span id="gatsby-1352-3">She wanted
                            her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of
                            money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1353-1">That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom
                            Buchanan.</span><span id="gatsby-1353-2">There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person
                            and his position, and Daisy was flattered.</span><span id="gatsby-1353-3">Doubtless there
                            was a certain struggle and a certain relief.</span><span id="gatsby-1353-4">The letter
                            reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1354-1">It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of
                            the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1354-2">The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began
                            to sing among the blue leaves.</span><span id="gatsby-1354-3">There was a slow, pleasant
                            movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1355-1">“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window
                            and looked at me challengingly.</span><span id="gatsby-1355-2">“You must remember, old
                            sport, she was very excited this afternoon.</span><span id="gatsby-1355-3">He told her those
                            things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap
                            sharper.</span><span id="gatsby-1355-4">And the result was she hardly knew what she was
                            saying.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1356-1">He sat down gloomily.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1357-1">“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were
                            first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1358-1">Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1359-1">“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1360-1">What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his
                            conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1361-1">He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding
                            trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army
                            pay.</span><span id="gatsby-1361-2">He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their
                            footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way
                            places to which they had driven in her white car.</span><span id="gatsby-1361-3">Just as
                            Daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his
                            idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy
                            beauty.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1362-1">He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found
                            her—that he was leaving her behind.</span><span id="gatsby-1362-2">The day-coach—he was
                            penniless now—was hot.</span><span id="gatsby-1362-3">He went out to the open vestibule and
                            sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings
                            moved by.</span><span id="gatsby-1362-4">Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow
                            trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of
                            her face along the casual street.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1363-1">The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it
                            sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had
                            drawn her breath.</span><span id="gatsby-1363-2">He stretched out his hand desperately as if
                            to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for
                            him.</span><span id="gatsby-1363-3">But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred
                            eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best,
                            forever.</span>

                            and there was an autumn flavour in the air.</span><span id="gatsby-1364-3">The gardener, the

                        <span id="gatsby-1378-1">“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn.</span><span

                        <span id="gatsby-1379-1">I’ve always been glad I said that.</span><span id="gatsby-1379-2">It
                            was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to
                            end.</span><span id="gatsby-1379-3">First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into
                            that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all
                            the time.</span><span id="gatsby-1379-4">His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot
                            of colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I first came to his
                            ancestral home, three months before.</span><span id="gatsby-1379-5">The lawn and drive had
                            been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption—and he had stood on those
                            steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.</span>

                            id="gatsby-1382-2">Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat breaking

                            up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and
                            private houses made her hard to find in any other way.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1382-4">Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool, as if a
                            divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the office window, but this morning it
                            seemed harsh and dry.</span>

                            id="gatsby-1395-3">Taking out my timetable, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty

                            be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the

                            and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic
                            achievement was forgotten.</span><span id="gatsby-1396-3">Now I want to go back a little and

                        <span id="gatsby-1397-1">They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1397-2">She must have broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she
                            arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already
                            gone to Flushing.</span><span id="gatsby-1397-3">When they convinced her of this, she
                            immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the affair.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1397-4">Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in the wake

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1398-1">Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front
                            of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch
                            inside.</span><span id="gatsby-1398-2">For a while the door of the office was open, and
                            everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1398-3">Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1398-4">Michaelis and several other men were with him; first, four or five men,
                            later two or three men.</span><span id="gatsby-1398-5">Still later Michaelis had to ask the
                            last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own place and
                            made a pot of coffee.</span><span id="gatsby-1398-6">After that, he stayed there alone with
                            Wilson until dawn.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1399-1">About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering
                            changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1399-2">He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car
                            belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the
                            city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1400-1">But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh,
                            my God!” again in his groaning voice.</span><span id="gatsby-1400-2">Michaelis made a clumsy

                            whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the
                            car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before.</span><span id="gatsby-1404-2">He didn’t like to
                            go into the garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he
                            moved uncomfortably around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from
                            time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-1419-1">Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen

                            conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he
                            began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter left several explanations in the

                        <span id="gatsby-1426-1">Wilson shook his head.</span><span id="gatsby-1426-2">His eyes narrowed
                            and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1427-1">“I know,” he said definitely.</span><span id="gatsby-1427-2">“I’m one

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1428-1">Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there
                            was any special significance in it.</span><span id="gatsby-1428-2">He believed that
                            Mrs.</span><span id="gatsby-1428-3">Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather
                            than trying to stop any particular car.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-1429-1">“How could she of been like that?”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1430-1">“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the
                            question.</span><span id="gatsby-1430-2">“Ah-h-h—”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1431-1">He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his
                            hand.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1432-1">“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1433-1">This was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:
                            there was not enough of him for his wife.</span><span id="gatsby-1433-2">He was glad a
                            little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and
                            realized that dawn wasn’t far off.</span><span id="gatsby-1433-3">About five o’clock it was
                            blue enough outside to snap off the light.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1434-1">Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey
                            clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1435-1">“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1435-2">“I told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool God.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1435-3">I took her to the window”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear
                            window and leaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what you’ve been
                            doing, everything you’ve been doing.</span><span id="gatsby-1435-4">You may fool me, but you
                            can’t fool God!’ ”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1436-1">Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at
                            the eyes of Doctor T.</span><span id="gatsby-1436-2">J.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1436-3">Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving
                            night.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1437-1">“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1438-1">“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1438-2">Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the
                            room.</span><span id="gatsby-1438-3">But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to
                            the window pane, nodding into the twilight.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1439-1">By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a
                            car stopping outside.</span><span id="gatsby-1439-2">It was one of the watchers of the night
                            before who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which he and the
                            other man ate together.</span><span id="gatsby-1439-3">Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis
                            went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage, Wilson
                            was gone.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1440-1">His movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to Port
                            Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that he didn’t eat, and a cup
                            of coffee.</span><span id="gatsby-1440-2">He must have been tired and walking slowly, for he
                            didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon.</span><span id="gatsby-1440-3">Thus far there was no
                            difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who had seen a man “acting sort of
                            crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1440-4">Then for three hours he disappeared from view.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1440-5">The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he “had a
                            way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage
                            thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car.</span><span id="gatsby-1440-6">On the other hand, no
                            garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of
                            finding out what he wanted to know.</span><span id="gatsby-1440-7">By half-past two he was
                            in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1440-8">So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1441-1">At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the
                            butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1441-2">He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his
                            guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1441-3">Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under
                            any circumstances—and this was strange, because the front right fender needed repair.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1442-1">Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1442-2">Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if
                            he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing
                            trees.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1443-1">No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep and
                            waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was anyone to give it to if it
                            came.</span><span id="gatsby-1443-2">I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it
                            would come, and perhaps he no longer cared.</span><span id="gatsby-1443-3">If that was true
                            he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long
                            with a single dream.</span><span id="gatsby-1443-4">He must have looked up at an unfamiliar
                            sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and
                            how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.</span><span id="gatsby-1443-5">A
                            new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air,
                            drifted fortuitously about… like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the
                            amorphous trees.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1444-1">The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the
                            shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything much about
                            them.</span><span id="gatsby-1444-2">I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house and
                            my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed anyone.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1444-3">But they knew then, I firmly believe.</span><span id="gatsby-1444-4">With
                            scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried down to the
                            pool.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1445-1">There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the
                            fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1445-2">With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden
                            mattress moved irregularly down the pool.</span><span id="gatsby-1445-3">A small gust of
                            wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with
                            its accidental burden.</span><span id="gatsby-1445-4">The touch of a cluster of leaves
                            revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1446-1">It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener
                            saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1447-1">IX
                            After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an
                            endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front
                            door.</span><span id="gatsby-1447-2">A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman
                            by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my
                            yard, and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1447-3">Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression
                            “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his
                            voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1448-1">Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial,
                            eager, and untrue.</span><span id="gatsby-1448-2">When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest
                            brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be
                            served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a
                            word.</span><span id="gatsby-1448-3">She showed a surprising amount of character about it
                            too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers, and swore
                            that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her
                            husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1448-4">She convinced herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the
                            very suggestion was more than she could endure.</span><span id="gatsby-1448-5">So Wilson was
                            reduced to a man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its simplest
                            form.</span><span id="gatsby-1448-6">And it rested there.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1449-1">But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1449-2">I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1449-3">From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village,
                            every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1449-4">At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and
                            didn’t move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible,
                            because no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest
                            to which everyone has some vague right at the end.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-1450-1">I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her
                            instinctively and without hesitation.</span><span id="gatsby-1450-2">But she and Tom had
                            gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-1578-1">One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school
                            and later from college at Christmas time.</span><span id="gatsby-1578-2">Those who went
                            farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December
                            evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gaieties, to
                            bid them a hasty goodbye.</span><span id="gatsby-1578-3">I remember the fur coats of the
                            girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands
                            waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations:
                            “Are you going to the Ordways’?</span><span id="gatsby-1578-4">the Herseys’?</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1578-5">the Schultzes’?” and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved
                            hands.</span><span id="gatsby-1578-6">And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago,
                            Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside
                            the gate.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1579-1">When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,
                            began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small
                            Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1579-2">We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the
                            cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour,
                            before we melted indistinguishably into it again.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-1580-1">That’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede
                            towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells
                            in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the
                            snow.</span><span id="gatsby-1580-2">I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of
                            those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city
                            where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1580-3">I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and
                            Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some
                            deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1581-1">Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware
                            of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their
                            interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old—even then it had
                            always for me a quality of distortion.</span><span id="gatsby-1581-2">West Egg, especially,
                            still figures in my more fantastic dreams.</span><span id="gatsby-1581-3">I see it as a
                            night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching
                            under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon.</span><span id="gatsby-1581-4">In the
                            foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on
                            which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress.</span><span id="gatsby-1581-5">Her
                            hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1581-6">Gravely the men turn in at a house—the wrong house.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1581-7">But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one cares.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-1582-1">After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted
                            beyond my eyes’ power of correction.</span><span id="gatsby-1582-2">So when the blue smoke
                            of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I
                            decided to come back home.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1583-1">There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant
                            thing that perhaps had better have been let alone.</span><span id="gatsby-1583-2">But I
                            wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to
                            sweep my refuse away.</span><span id="gatsby-1583-3">I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and
                            around what had happened to us together, and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay
                            perfectly still, listening, in a big chair.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1584-1">She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a
                            good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the colour of an autumn leaf,
                            her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1584-2">When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to
                            another man.</span><span id="gatsby-1584-3">I doubted that, though there were several she
                            could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1584-4">For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought
                            it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1585-1">“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1585-2">“You threw me over on the telephone.</span><span id="gatsby-1585-3">I
                            don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little
                            dizzy for a while.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1586-1">We shook hands.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-1587-1">“Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once about

                        <span id="gatsby-1591-1">She didn’t answer.</span><span id="gatsby-1591-2">Angry, and half in

                        <span id="gatsby-1592-1">One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan.</span><span

                            way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving
                            sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1592-3">Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning
                            into the windows of a jewellery store.</span><span id="gatsby-1592-4">Suddenly he saw me and
                            walked back, holding out his hand.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-1593-1">“What’s the matter, Nick?</span><span id="gatsby-1593-2">Do you object

                        <span id="gatsby-1595-1">“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly.</span><span

                        <span id="gatsby-1597-1">He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about

                            perhaps he had made a story about it all his own.</span><span id="gatsby-1603-3">I didn’t
                            want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1604-1">I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling
                            parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter,
                            faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1604-2">One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his
                            front steps.</span><span id="gatsby-1604-3">But I didn’t investigate.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1604-4">Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the
                            earth and didn’t know that the party was over.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1605-1">On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,
                            I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1605-2">On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of
                            brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along
                            the stone.</span><span id="gatsby-1605-3">Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out
                            on the sand.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1606-1">Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any
                            lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1606-2">And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away
                            until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’
                            eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world.</span><span id="gatsby-1606-3">Its vanished
                            trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the
                            last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held
                            his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he
                            neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something
                            commensurate to his capacity for wonder.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1607-1">And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of
                            Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s
                            dock.</span><span id="gatsby-1607-2">He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream
                            must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-1607-3">He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that
                            vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the
                            night.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1608-1">Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by
                            year recedes before us.</span><span id="gatsby-1608-2">It eluded us then, but that’s no
                            matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further… And one fine
                            morning—</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1609-1">So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into
                            the past.</span>
