                <div id="book-wrapper">
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-1-1">In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that
                            I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-2-1">“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember
                            that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-3-1">He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a
                            reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-3-2">In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has
                            opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran
                            bores.</span><span id="gatsby-3-3">The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to
                            this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was
                            unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,
                            unknown men.</span><span id="gatsby-3-4">Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I
                            have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable
                            sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations
                            of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and
                            marred by obvious suppressions.</span><span id="gatsby-3-5">Reserving judgements is a matter
                            of infinite hope.</span><span id="gatsby-3-6">I am still a little afraid of missing
                            something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a
                            sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-4-1">And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that
                            it has a limit.</span><span id="gatsby-4-2">Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the
                            wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-4-3">When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to
                            be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions
                            with privileged glimpses into the human heart.</span><span id="gatsby-4-4">Only Gatsby, the
                            man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented
                            everything for which I have an unaffected scorn.</span><span id="gatsby-4-5">If personality
                            is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,
                            some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those
                            intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-4-6">This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability
                            which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift
                            for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it
                            is not likely I shall ever find again.</span><span id="gatsby-4-7">No—Gatsby turned out all
                            right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his
                            dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded
                            elations of men.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-5-1">My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western
                            city for three generations.</span><span id="gatsby-5-2">The Carraways are something of a
                            clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the
                            actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a
                            substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father
                            carries on today.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-6-1">I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with
                            special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s
                            office.</span><span id="gatsby-6-2">I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a
                            century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic
                            migration known as the Great War.</span><span id="gatsby-6-3">I enjoyed the counter-raid so
                            thoroughly that I came back restless.</span><span id="gatsby-6-4">Instead of being the warm
                            centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I
                            decided to go East and learn the bond business.</span><span id="gatsby-6-5">Everybody I knew
                            was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-6-6">All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep
                            school for me, and finally said, “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-6-7">Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came
                            East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-7-1">The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm
                            season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man
                            at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a
                            great idea.</span><span id="gatsby-7-2">He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard
                            bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I
                            went out to the country alone.</span><span id="gatsby-7-3">I had a dog—at least I had him
                            for a few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and
                            cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-8-1">It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently
                            arrived than I, stopped me on the road.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-9-1">“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-10-1">I told him.</span><span id="gatsby-10-2">And as I walked on I was lonely
                            no longer.</span><span id="gatsby-10-3">I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original
                            settler.</span><span id="gatsby-10-4">He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the
                            neighbourhood.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-11-1">And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the
                            trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was
                            beginning over again with the summer.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-12-1">There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be
                            pulled down out of the young breath-giving air.</span><span id="gatsby-12-2">I bought a
                            dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in
                            red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only
                            Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew.</span><span id="gatsby-12-3">And I had the high
                            intention of reading many other books besides.</span><span id="gatsby-12-4">I was rather
                            literary in college—one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the
                            Yale News—and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again
                            that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an
                            epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-13-1">It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the
                            strangest communities in North America.</span><span id="gatsby-13-2">It was on that slender
                            riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other
                            natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land.</span><span id="gatsby-13-3">Twenty
                            miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a
                            courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western
                            hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.</span><span id="gatsby-13-4">They
                            are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the
                            contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls
                            that fly overhead.</span><span id="gatsby-13-5">To the wingless a more interesting
                            phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-14-1">I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though
                            this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast
                            between them.</span><span id="gatsby-14-2">My house was at the very tip of the egg, only
                            fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or
                            fifteen thousand a season.</span><span id="gatsby-14-3">The one on my right was a colossal
                            affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a
                            tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool,
                            and more than forty acres of lawn and garden.</span><span id="gatsby-14-4">It was Gatsby’s
                            mansion.</span><span id="gatsby-14-5">Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a
                            mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name.</span><span id="gatsby-14-6">My own house was
                            an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the
                            water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of
                            millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-15-1">Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg
                            glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I
                            drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans.</span><span id="gatsby-15-2">Daisy
                            was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-15-3">And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-16-1">Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the
                            most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of
                            those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward
                            savours of anticlimax.</span><span id="gatsby-16-2">His family were enormously wealthy—even
                            in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and
                            come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a
                            string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.</span><span id="gatsby-16-3">It was hard to realize
                            that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-17-1">Why they came East I don’t know.</span><span id="gatsby-17-2">They had
                            spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully
                            wherever people played polo and were rich together.</span><span id="gatsby-17-3">This was a
                            permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into
                            Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for
                            the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-18-1">And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg
                            to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all.</span><span id="gatsby-18-2">Their house
                            was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion,
                            overlooking the bay.</span><span id="gatsby-18-3">The lawn started at the beach and ran
                            towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and
                            burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as
                            though from the momentum of its run.</span><span id="gatsby-18-4">The front was broken by a
                            line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy
                            afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front
                            porch.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-19-1">He had changed since his New Haven years.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-19-2">Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth
                            and a supercilious manner.</span><span id="gatsby-19-3">Two shining arrogant eyes had
                            established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning
                            aggressively forward.</span><span id="gatsby-19-4">Not even the effeminate swank of his
                            riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening
                            boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting
                            when his shoulder moved under his thin coat.</span><span id="gatsby-19-5">It was a body
                            capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-20-1">His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of
                            fractiousness he conveyed.</span><span id="gatsby-20-2">There was a touch of paternal
                            contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated
                            his guts.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-21-1">“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to
                            say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior
                            society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me
                            and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-22-1">We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-23-1">“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about
                            restlessly.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-24-1">Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front
                            vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses,
                            and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-25-1">“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again,
                            politely and abruptly.</span><span id="gatsby-25-2">“We’ll go inside.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-26-1">We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,
                            fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-26-2">The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside
                            that seemed to grow a little way into the house.</span><span id="gatsby-26-3">A breeze blew
                            through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting
                            them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the
                            wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-27-1">The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch
                            on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-27-2">They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as
                            if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-27-3">I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the
                            curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.</span><span id="gatsby-27-4">Then there was
                            a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room,
                            and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-28-1">The younger of the two was a stranger to me.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-28-2">She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely
                            motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it
                            which was quite likely to fall.</span><span id="gatsby-28-3">If she saw me out of the corner
                            of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology
                            for having disturbed her by coming in.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-29-1">The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly
                            forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh,
                            and I laughed too and came forward into the room.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-30-1">“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-31-1">She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand
                            for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so
                            much wanted to see.</span><span id="gatsby-31-2">That was a way she had.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-31-3">She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was
                            Baker.</span><span id="gatsby-31-4">(I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make
                            people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-32-1">At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost
                            imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had
                            obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-32-2">Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-32-3">Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute
                            from me.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-33-1">I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,
                            thrilling voice.</span><span id="gatsby-33-2">It was the kind of voice that the ear follows
                            up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played
                            again.</span><span id="gatsby-33-3">Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,
                            bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men
                            who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,”
                            a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,
                            exciting things hovering in the next hour.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-34-1">I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and
                            how a dozen people had sent their love through me.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-35-1">“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-36-1">“The whole town is desolate.</span><span id="gatsby-36-2">All the cars
                            have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail
                            all night along the north shore.”</span>
                    </p>

                            Tom.</span><span id="gatsby-37-3">Tomorrow!” Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought to see
                            the baby.”</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-42-1">Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped
                            and rested his hand on my shoulder.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-46-1">I told him.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-47-1">“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-48-1">This annoyed me.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-49-1">“You will,” I answered shortly.</span><span id="gatsby-49-2">“You will if
                            you stay in the East.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-50-1">“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy
                            and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-50-2">“I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-51-1">At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I
                            started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-51-2">Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a
                            series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-52-1">“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as

                        <span id="gatsby-53-1">“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to New

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-54-1">“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-55-1">Her host looked at her incredulously.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-56-1">“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-57-1">I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I enjoyed
                            looking at her.</span><span id="gatsby-57-2">She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an
                            erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-61-1">“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy.</span><span id="gatsby-61-2">“What
                            Gatsby?”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-62-1">Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;
                            wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as
                            though he were moving a checker to another square.</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-63-1">Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two
                            young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward the sunset, where four
                            candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-64-1">“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning.</span><span id="gatsby-64-2">She
                            snapped them out with her fingers.</span><span id="gatsby-64-3">“In two weeks it’ll be the

                        <span id="gatsby-65-1">“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-66-1">“All right,” said Daisy.</span><span id="gatsby-66-2">“What’ll we plan?”
                            She turned to me helplessly: “What do people plan?”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-67-1">Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-71-1">“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-72-1">“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-73-1">Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a
                            bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white
                            dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-73-2">They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant
                            effort to entertain or to be entertained.</span><span id="gatsby-73-3">They knew that
                            presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually
                            put away.</span><span id="gatsby-73-4">It was sharply different from the West, where an
                            evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed
                            anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-74-1">“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass of
                            corky but rather impressive claret.</span><span id="gatsby-74-2">“Can’t you talk about crops
                            or something?”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-75-1">I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-76-1">“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-76-2">“I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things.</span><span

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-77-1">“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-78-1">“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it.</span><span

                        <span id="gatsby-79-1">“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of
                            unthoughtful sadness.</span><span id="gatsby-79-2">“He reads deep books with long words in
                            them.</span><span id="gatsby-79-3">What was that word we—”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-80-1">“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her
                            impatiently.</span><span id="gatsby-80-2">“This fellow has worked out the whole
                            thing.</span><span id="gatsby-80-3">It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out
                            or these other races will have control of things.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-81-1">“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously
                            toward the fervent sun.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-82-1">“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted
                            her by shifting heavily in his chair.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-83-1">“This idea is that we’re Nordics.</span><span id="gatsby-83-2">I am, and
                            you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a
                            slight nod, and she winked at me again.</span><span id="gatsby-83-3">“—And we’ve produced
                            all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that.</span><span

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-84-1">There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency,
                            more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.</span><span id="gatsby-84-2">When,
                            almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized
                            upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-85-1">“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered
                            enthusiastically.</span><span id="gatsby-85-2">“It’s about the butler’s nose.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-85-3">Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”</span>

                        <span id="gatsby-86-1">“That’s why I came over tonight.”</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-87-1">“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for

                            id="gatsby-87-2">He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to

                        <span id="gatsby-88-1">“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-89-1">“Yes.</span><span id="gatsby-89-2">Things went from bad to worse, until

                        <span id="gatsby-90-1">For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her
                            glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded,
                            each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at
                            dusk.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-91-1">The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon
                            Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-91-2">As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward

                        <span id="gatsby-94-1">Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of

                            “Sh!” in a warning voice.</span><span id="gatsby-94-3">A subdued impassioned murmur was
                            audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to

                            mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.</span>

                            time.</span><span id="gatsby-103-2">Don’t you think?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-104-1">Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress
                            and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-105-1">“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-106-1">She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and
                            continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-106-2">There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on
                            the Cunard or White Star Line.</span><span id="gatsby-106-3">He’s singing away—” Her voice
                            sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-107-1">“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light
                            enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-108-1">The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head
                            decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into
                            air.</span><span id="gatsby-108-2">Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at
                            table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to
                            look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes.</span><span id="gatsby-108-3">I
                            couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed
                            to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s
                            shrill metallic urgency out of mind.</span><span id="gatsby-108-4">To a certain temperament
                            the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for
                            the police.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-109-1">The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-109-2">Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled
                            back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to
                            look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting
                            verandas to the porch in front.</span><span id="gatsby-109-3">In its deep gloom we sat down
                            side by side on a wicker settee.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-110-1">Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her
                            eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk.</span><span id="gatsby-110-2">I saw that
                            turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions
                            about her little girl.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-111-1">“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said

                            id="gatsby-111-3">You didn’t come to my wedding.”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-113-1">“That’s true.” She hesitated.</span><span id="gatsby-113-2">“Well, I’ve
                            had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-114-1">Evidently she had reason to be.</span><span id="gatsby-114-2">I waited
                            but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of
                            her daughter.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-116-1">“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently.</span><span

                        <span id="gatsby-118-1">“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-118-2">Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows
                            where.</span><span id="gatsby-118-3">I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned
                            feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-118-4">She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and
                            wept.</span><span id="gatsby-118-5">‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-118-6">And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this

                        <span id="gatsby-119-1">“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a
                            convinced way.</span><span id="gatsby-119-2">“Everybody thinks so—the most advanced
                            people.</span><span id="gatsby-119-3">And I know.</span><span id="gatsby-119-4">I’ve been
                            everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a
                            defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-119-5">“Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!”</span>

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-120-1">The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my
                            belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.</span><span id="gatsby-120-2">It
                            made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a
                            contributory emotion from me.</span><span id="gatsby-120-3">I waited, and sure enough, in a
                            moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted
                            her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom
                            belonged.</span>

                            id="gatsby-121-2">Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud
                            to him from the Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together
                            in a soothing tune.</span><span id="gatsby-121-3">The lamplight, bright on his boots and
                            dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page
                            with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.</span>
                    </p>

                        <span id="gatsby-122-1">When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted

                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-123-1">“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our

                            motor Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-145-1">“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-145-2">We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-146-1">“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-146-2">“We heard that you were engaged.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-147-1">“It’s a libel.</span><span id="gatsby-147-2">I’m too poor.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-148-1">“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in
                            a flower-like way.</span><span id="gatsby-148-2">“We heard it from three people, so it must
                            be true.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-149-1">Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely
                            engaged.</span><span id="gatsby-149-2">The fact that gossip had published the banns was one
                            of the reasons I had come East.</span><span id="gatsby-149-3">You can’t stop going with an
                            old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured
                            into marriage.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-150-1">Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely
                            rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-150-2">It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the
                            house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-150-3">As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less
                            surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-150-4">Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his
                            sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-151-1">Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside
                            garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate
                            at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in
                            the yard.</span><span id="gatsby-151-2">The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright
                            night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of
                            the earth blew the frogs full of life.</span><span id="gatsby-151-3">The silhouette of a
                            moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was
                            not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour’s mansion and
                            was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the
                            stars.</span><span id="gatsby-151-4">Something in his leisurely movements and the secure
                            position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to
                            determine what share was his of our local heavens.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="gatsby-152-1">I decided to call to him.</span><span id="gatsby-152-2">Miss Baker had
                            mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-152-3">But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was
                            content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and,
                            far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-152-4">Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single
                            green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.</span><span
                            id="gatsby-152-5">When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again
                            in the unquiet darkness.</span>
