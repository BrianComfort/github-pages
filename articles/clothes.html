</ul>
<h3 id="Where-Brands">Where brands get their clothes</h3>
<p>Brands like Tillys typically order clothes from the manufacture itself. An example can be billabong.com or addias.com</p>
<h3 id="Cost-To">Cost To Entry</h3>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I think you can easily lose money doing this. However, that doesn't mean you can't get any either. In a worse case scenario, clothes don't sell and that's that, now you have stuff to sell on Facebook Marketplace.</p>
<p>But to actaully answer the question, I think it truly depends on how much supply and marketing you need. At the end of the day, online ecommerce is soley dependant on finding buyers which is often online.</p>
<p>I'd set 500 dollars for this. 150 on clothes, and the rest on marketing. Since I know how to build ecommece sites, building it is easy. I also have a lot of storage to hold all the clothes.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe I'm wrong. For the future reader, let me know!</p>
<h3 id="How-Market">How Clothing Brands Market</h3>
<p>With a little bit of reaserch, I found that most brands like Tillys and PacSun market in two diffrent ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Models show off shirts</li>
</ol>
<p>The caveat to this is that models are expensive and to make it profitiable, we'll need a lot of shirts so they can wear a lot at the same time. Also, you need a lot of models for it to work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Just showing the photo of the clothing piece against a solid background (mostly white)</li>
</ol>
<p>I think this is perfectly fine for starting out, but does require a camrea (phone) and some white lights to get it perfect. When taking photos, we take it from multipe angles so when the user goes to incpect the article of clothing, they have multiple shots of it.</p>
<p>Now both of these can be used for advertising purposes, and I think the first method is more efective in customer accusition. Again, the second is good to start out with.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a lesson in buiness school but I think marketing is done in two diffrent ways as well:</p>
<ol>
<li>Direct</li>
<li>Indirect</li>
</ol>
<p>By direct, I mean the photos themselves, the advertisements etc. By indirect, I say the brand itself, the logos the colors the instagram accounts.</p>
<p>That being said, brand does mean a lot in the long run and such I think should be considered.</p>
<h2 id="Action">Action Plan</h2>
<p>After getting a grain of sand about ecommerce stores, I figured I'll probbaly learn the most from actaully doing it. That being said, I figured I should begin laying out the steps toward making this happen.</p>
<h3 id="Step-One">Step One: Create a Brand</h3>
<p>The first step is to create a brand. I can't being emailing manufactures without having a brand, a location and a website up.</p>
<h4 id="brand">Branding</h4>
<p>I need to create a brand that encompasses what I'm selling but doesn't confine me to one catagory. I like the names backcountry, tillys, pacsun etc, but all of these are for a specfic niche that limits future growth oppertunites.</p>
<h5 id="">Licence</h5>
<p>I also need to register for an LLC as well as a bank account.</p>
<h4 id="">Colors</h4>
<p>A good color design is important. (Maybe black white and an earth brown)</p>
<h4 id="Website">Website</h4>
<p>I need to create a website. Since I like making sites this step isn't too difficult but I can make it preety difficult on myslef if I want to. AKA, I need to decide to use vanilla html, css, and js or go for a more complex web frameworks like react, svelte, vue etc.</p>
<p><a href="#backend">see more in backend</a></p>
<h4 id="socials">Socials</h4>
<p>Whatever name I need means I need to set up social medias on all platforms. Since I'm thinking of advertising primarilly on social media, these pages are going to be very crucial to the sucess of the buiness.</p>
<h2 id="backend">Backend</h2>
<p>The backend is the most complex (stil doable) part of this project. I'm pretty familiar with services like Stripe, Flask and AWS which means that the web parts of this are going to be quite easy. But aside from the web part, things like phyical storage and shipping is some uncharted terroitory for me.</p>
<h3 id="Web-App">Web Application</h3>
<p>The webstack I'm going to use is the one I'm most comfortable with which is Flask and AWS. I'll use a single ec2 instance to start as almost all customers are going to be from the U.S and canada. Using a single instance makes it a lot easier to figure out databases as well as load blanacning. I should explore other options but this is most likely going to be the best solution to my problems.</p>
<h4 id="Databases">Databases</h4>
<p>I'm not the best at databases but what I need is to have a database with order Id's and the fuffilment of id's. I'm thinking a traditional postgres or mysql would be the best option for this.</p>
<p>This means on the websever, I'll need to have a function that can create and write those ids and as for the "real world", I should make a python program for myself so when an order is fuffiled, I can send an email, fuffil the order id, and then write to a log book the reveune, profit etc.</p>
<p>Also, I'll need a database with every indviual product, their accomnping photos (like the photo of the back, the front the side), the size of the shirt, the color, the brand etc. Even better, I should make the database include number purchased, left in stock, as well as the amount of clicks each shirt recives.</p>
<h4 id="Layout">Website Layout</h4>
<p>For the website iteself, I'm thinking of making a single load page with filters on the side. The site will load more clothes as the user scrolls, when they reach the end, clothes will be recycled to the bottom. The landing page will include the link to the /store route and of course, the site will have the provacy plocy etc.</p>
<p>Indivual checkout on items will look similar to stripe checouts, with the product on the left. Keep in mind that most of the target audince wil be on mobile.</p>
<h3 id="physical">Phyical Space</h3>
<p>As disscussed before, the physical set up will be important as well.</p>
<h4 id="storage">Storage</h4>
<p>For the beginingg, I'll use the shop outside to hold the clothes I bought. Each hanger will have a number on it. A local database hosted on this device will have the product id corrsponing to the number on the rack. When I recive an order, the python script will show the image of the order, the product id and the correspoiing rack number. When I get ready to ship it, I'll run a function that updates it.</p>
