                <h2 id="what-i-start-with">What I start With</h2>
                <p>The initial attempt at making an algo to be able to trade stock based off of incomplete data was sort
                    of a success. I opted to use multiple forms of machine learning methods to come up with an outcome
                    of Y/N.</p>
                <p>Some of those methods are listed here:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chat-GPT 3.5 Turbo</li>
                    <li>Pure Linear Regression</li>
                    <li>Random Forest Regression</li>
                </ul>
                <p>From using those, I found that using Random Forest Regression got a somewhat accurate prediction of a
                    closing and opening price of a stock the day after. But the question if it's a viable way to invest
                    money is an absolute no.</p>
                <p>Which is why I'm here, planning out a new way to tackle this project.</p>
                <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
                <h3 id="preface">A Preface</h3>
                <p>Machine Learning is difficult, but not impossible. Even more, a model that can predict stock is
                    difficult, but not impossible. The objective of this machine learning project is not to create a
                    model that can predict every single price, rather to create a model that can predict correctly more
                    than incorrectly, which is where profit lies.</p>
                <p>Where to start this journey is with a chat-gpt question on the most basic principals of machine
                    learning. It's answer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data</li>
                    <li>Model</li>
                    <li>Training</li>
                    <li>Testing/Evaluation</li>
                    <li>Validation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The structure of these research notes will follow in this order.</p>
                <h3 id="data">Data</h3>
                <p>Data collection for stock prices is actually pretty straight forward since they're many services that
                    are readily available to the average developer such as the Yahoo Finance API or the Apache Finance
                    API. Both options are good and free, but do not have full coverage of every day of stock prices (But
                    it's pretty close). In development, I'll use these apis to create a stock_data.csv file that will be
                    the training and testing data.</p>
                <h3 id="model">Model</h3>
                <p>The model is debatably the biggest part of this project as it's going to be the deciding factor on
                    its performance. Since I have already attempted to make a machine learning algo (<a
                        href="#what-i-start-with">what I start with</a>) and have tested and tried some things, I found
                    that random forest regression from sklkit learn is debatably the best I've used. I found another
                    source today to back this claim up (<a
                        href="https://dataconomy.com/2023/01/11/stock-prediction-machine-learning/">Stock Prediction
                        Machine Learning</a>). For now, I'll be using this function to predict but later down the road,
                    I'll be using a lot of methods.</p>
                <h3 id="testing">Testing/Evaluation</h3>
                <p>The structure of this project revolves around a final outcome of buy or sell, a boolean value. But
                    everything before that is going to provide a percentage of the likelihood of a guess. Evaluating
                    stock's is easy as data is continually being poured into it so this step is more about structure the
                    physical code rather than finding testing data.</p>
                <h3 id="validation">Validation</h3>
                <p>As with <a href="#testing">Testing/Evaluation</a>, validating the effectiveness of the model is not
                    difficult at all as data is continually being poured into the model daily.</p>
