# github-pages

The repository for briancomfort's github pages. 

Its marked as public as I want to be able to view the pages iregardless if I am signed in, however, the information here is almost all useless description code that isn't useful for anyone but myself. So feel free to look around, but again, its pretty useless to do so. 
Thanks!
Brian Comfort
